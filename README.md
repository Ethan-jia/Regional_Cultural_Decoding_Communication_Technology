# Decoding Cultural Tourism Genes and Intelligent Communication Platform

## Project Background

This project is a **Major Special Science and Technology Innovation Project 2025 of xxx**, led by the XXX Institute of Cultural Tourism, aiming to achieve digital decoding and precise dissemination of regional cultural genes through artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain technology, contributing to the creation of a culturally strong city.

**Core Objectives**：
- Build a specialized cultural gene library (with over 100TB of data and 200,000 hours of audio-visual resources)
- Develop an intelligent short video synthesis and precise push system
- Serve 50 million users with a precision rate of over 90%
- Apply for 4 patents, 6 software copyrights, and publish 10 papers

## System Architecture

### 1. Aggregation and Processing of Multi-source Heterogeneous Cultural Gene Resources

- **Research on Aggregation Methods for Multi-cultural Content**：
  
  Starting with local culture, we comprehensively sort through cultural elements centered around three main types: traditional culture, revolutionary culture, and advanced socialist culture, and catalog them to form a two-tier cultural gene library at the municipal and county (city, district) levels. Secondly, according to the development history of culture, based on ancient books, archaeological discoveries, artifacts, etc., we extract material and spiritual, linguistic, and symbolic elements, and select the most critical "knowledge (technical) points" to achieve cultural gene decoding. The decoded cultural genes are evaluated in terms of vitality, cohesion, influence, and development potential.

- **Research on Constructing a Specialized Cultural Gene Resource Library**：

  After decoding, we scientifically and systematically encode the cultural genes to form the "one table, one document, one spectrum, one library" of the cultural gene decoding project, and record and archive the evidence. We dig out the "most distinctive" elements with outstanding cultural value, distinct cultural characteristics, and significant cultural impact, establish a cultural gene library, scientifically interpret them in combination with new practices and the requirements of the times, conduct research on activation and reorganization, and construct a cultural knowledge graph.
 
- **Research on Cataloging Specifications for Cultural Gene Video Resources**：

  Using deep neural networks, we perform multi-label classification of cultural audio-visual content based on the cultural gene graph, adding labels to the data in the multi-source heterogeneous multimedia resource library. Through audio-visual content analysis and decoding, classification labeling, data storage, and other processes, we complete the intelligent processing of cultural genes. Finally, the formed key frames and labels are summarized and recorded in the resource library to form a cultural gene video element library, preparing for later user portrait construction, analysis, and precise push work.
  
### 2.Research Methods for Video Intelligent Analysis and Data Storage

Data mining is a hot topic in artificial intelligence and database research. Data mining refers to the process of revealing implicit, previously unknown, and potentially valuable information from large amounts of data in a database. Data mining is a decision support process that mainly relies on artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, visualization technology, etc., to highly automate data analysis and make inductive reasoning to mine potential patterns from it. The analysis methods of data mining include association analysis, cluster analysis, classification analysis, anomaly analysis, exceptional group analysis, and evolution analysis.

### 3.Research Methods for Precise Video Push

Precise push mostly refers to new media placing news, videos, products, etc., that people want to see in priority positions based on the information processing of big data. With the popularization and application of network communication technology, especially mobile communication technology, personalized, decentralized, and customized tourism has increased significantly. High-quality leisure tourism, branded customized tourism, and cultural experience tourism have become hot demands in the market. For example, short videos represented by Douyin (TikTok) have made many online celebrity scenic spots and cities popular. Chongqing, where a light rail passes through a building, and Xi'an, known for its "social people drinking bowl-breaking wine," have attracted large numbers of tourists due to their high online exposure and likes. At the same time, changes in payment methods have promoted the upgrading of tourism consumption. Six marketing innovations, represented by virtual technology and full-chain cooperation, create new tourism experiences, requiring cities to launch more diversified and high-quality tourism products.

## Key Technical Issues and Key Technical Pathways

The research of this project requires the support of multiple key technologies, mainly including heterogeneous multi-source cultural gene resource aggregation and information visualization technology, cultural gene resource content verification and security service technology (blockchain), large-scale audio-visual resource digital conversion and cataloging technology, and precise push service technology for thematic works based on deep learning. These technologies provide efficient and secure support for urban cultural gene decoding and precise push services, promoting their development towards digitization, intelligence, and networking. The specific technical route is shown in the figure below:
